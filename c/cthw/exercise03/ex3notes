This file is meant to explain what's happening in the file ex3.c

First we #include <stdio.h>, which is the standard input/output library.
Next is some variable declarations.
Now we have printf, which prints a string. The %d character gets replaced by the int specified after the comma.

printf escape codes: 

\a  07  Bell
\b  08  Backspace
\f  0C  Formfeed
\n  0A  Newline
\r  0D  Carriage return
\t  09  Horizontal tab
\v  0B  Vertical tab
\\  5C  Backslash
\'  27  Single quote
\"  22  Double quote
\?  3F  Question mark
\nnn    Interpret nnn as octal
\xhh    Interpret hh as hex

Format placeholders:

syntax for these placeholders is:
    
    %[parameter][flags][width][.precision][length]type

n$  n is the number of the parameter to display thi format specifier. (see wikipedia for more)

Flags:

-   Left-align the output of this placeholder
+   Prepend a plus for positive signed numeric types. positive='+' negative='-'
    (space) prepends a space for positive signed numeric types positive=' ', negative='-'
0   when width is specified, prepends zeroes for numeric types (default is spaces)
#   alternate form:
    for 'g' and 'G' types, trailing zeroes are removed
    for 'f', 'F', 'e', 'E', 'g', 'G' types output always has a decimal point
    for 'o', 'x', 'X' types, the text '0', '0x', and '0X' respectively is prepended to non-zero numbers
