/* 
 * nxw, by Newnix of Exile Heavy Industries
 * This is meant to be a simple web browser, 
 * inspired by dwb and aurora. 
 *
 * It will not support JS or any other interactive
 * scripting, it will not support plugins, might 
 * have tab support, and should support the latest
 * security options from a crypto library like libressl
 * for handling connections. 
 *
 * It may support opening rtmp or rtsp links for watching 
 * live streams, but otherwise will only support static content,
 * like w3m or elinks, but without the limitations of running in a 
 * terminal emulator.
