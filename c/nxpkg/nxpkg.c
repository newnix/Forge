/* 
 * nxpkg, by Newnix of Exile Heavy Industries
 *
 * Ideally a relatively quick and capable package manager,
 * meant to tolerate retrieving packages from torrent files
 * and verifying their integrity against a known list of 
 * available checksums and signatures. 
 *
 * It will also allow unprivileged installs to arbitrary locations
 * in the filesystem, so a user could run `nxpkg -d ~/bin -i nxi` 
 * to install nxi from any and all peers that currently have a copy
 * of the package stored. Making it possible to have a completely 
 * distributed and decentralised repo available to end users.
