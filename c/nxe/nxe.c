/* 
 * nxe, by Newnix of Exile Heavy Industries
 * this is meant to be a simple, ViM-like modal editor
 *
 * It will not be feature or bug compatible with ViM, 
 * but should be familiar enough for users of Vi, ViM,
 * nViM, and ed to be comfortable.
 *
 * Ideally this will be extremely simple and relatively fast, 
 * mostly written in C or a functional language.
