// practice header file
// just for a simple addition function
// created 20150718

// This is the start of the header guard. ADD_H can be any unique name, but by convention it's the same name of the header file

#ifndef ADD_H
#define ADD_H

// This is the content of the .d file, which is where the declarations go

int add(int x, int y); //function prototype for add.h -- don't forget the semicolon

// Still need to include the add.cpp file when using the add.h header

// this is the end of the header guard
