// Variable Names

int value; // good
int Value; // bad, always start with lowercase
int VALUE; // bad, stick with lowercase as much as possible
int VaLuE; // very bad. don't ever do this shit.

int my_variable_name; // good, underscores are awesome
int myVariableName; // good, camelCase is also accepted
int my variable name; // bad, creating multiple vars here
int MyVariableName; // bad, stick to lowercase

// Some examples of var names
int ccount; // bad, what's a ccount?
int customerCount; // good, obvious what's happening
int i; // generally a bad idea, except in simple functions
int index; // could be clearer
int totalScore; // great, obvious
int _count; // don't start vars with underscores
int count; // ok, but what are we counting?
int data; // bad, what data?
int value1, value2; // can be difficult to keep them straight
int numberOfApples; // good, very clear
int monsterskilled; // good, very clear
int x, y; // bad idea in anything other than very basic functions or math

// Reading long lines
It's best to split long lines with a tab on the subsequent line:

cout << "this is an example of a line going on for much longer than is"<<
     "reasonable to have on one line";

// Forward Declaration
It is possible to run a function after main(), but if it's not declared prior
to main, or written in its entirety, we need to use a forward declaration.
Such as:

int add(int x, int y);

this gives the system enough information to run the function called after
main(). This particular statement happens to be called a prototype.

// Some addressing operators related to pointers and data structures

s->m:
's' is a structure pointer and 'm' is a member. This expression accesses the
'm' memeber of the structure pointed to by 's'.

*a.p:
'a' is a structure variable and 'p', a pointer is a member. This expression
dereferences the value pointed to by 'p'.

(*s).m:
's' is a structure pointer and 'm' is a member. The '*' operator dereferences
's', causing the expression to access the member of the structure pointed to
by 's'. This expression is the same as s->m. 

*s->p:
's' is a structure pointer and 'p', a pointer, is a member of the structure
pointed to by 's'. This expression accesses the value pointed to by 'p'. ( the
-> operator dereferences 's' and the '*' operator dereferences 'p'.)

*(*s).p:
's' is a structure pointer and 'p', a pointer, is a member of the structure
pointed to by 's'. This expression accesses the value pointed to by 'p'. (*s)
dereferences 's' and the outermost '*' operator dereferences 'p'. This is
equivalent to *s->p.
