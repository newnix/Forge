<h1>Newnix's Forge</h1>
<p>
This is where I work on some coding projects, they may or may not eventually 
be moved to a separate repo of their own, depending on complexity and size.<br>
The primary goal with this repo is simply education, learning how to build
things with various languages.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all code in this repo is licensed under the 3-Clause BSD
License, basically meaning you can take this code and use it for whatever you want, 
but you can't sue me if it doesn't work, and you can't say that you wrote it.<br>
I'd rather you not make something proprietary with what I write because I don't like
proprietary software, but I'm not going to tell you how to run your life (like some 
other licenses).

<h3>Actual Code</h3>
<p><pre>
lang[0] = <a href="https://exile.digital/code/c">C</a>; /* My C projects, current favorite language */
lang[1] = <a href="https://exile.digital/code/cpp">C++</a>; /* C++ projects, mostly school assignments */
lang[2] = <a href="https://exile.digital/code/asm">ASM</a>; /* AMD64 Assembly */
lang[3] = <a href="https://exile.digital/code/rust">Rust</a>; /* Rust, very interested in this language */
lang[4] = <a href="https://exile.digital/code/haskell">Haskell</a>; /* Getting the basics of Functional Programming */
lang[5] = <a href="htpts://exile.digital/code/sysutil">Sysutil</a>; /* System Utilities (usually shell scripts) */
lang[6] = <a href="https://exile.digital/code/bash">Bash</a>; /* Bash scripts */

<h3>Repo Info</h3>
<p>
While I plan on having this repo mirrored and available through multiple DVCS-es, 
(e.g. git, mercurial, maybe bzr) it's currently only a darcs repo.<br>
To obtain a copy for yourself, use the command:
<pre>
darcs clone https://exile.digital/code ${destdir}
</pre>
